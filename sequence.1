.SH NAME
\fBsequence \fP- Run all executables in a directory in sequence.

.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBsequence\fP [\fB-0\fP] [\fB-i\fP] [\fB-p\fP] [\fB-v\fP] [\fB-h\fP] \fIdirectory\fP [\fIoptions\fP]

.SH DESCRIPTION

The \fBsequence\fP command runs all the executables in a specified \fIdirectory\fP,
running each one in \fBsequence\fP ordered alphabetically.
.PP
Each executable is named clearly in argv[0] or ${0} so it is
clear which executable is responsible for output in syslog.
.PP
Sequence is an alternative to the run-parts command found in cron.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B
\fB-0\fP, \fB--zero\fP
Terminate names with a zero instead of newline.
.TP
.B
\fB-i\fP, \fB--ignore\fP
Ignore non executable files. See the note below.
.TP
.B
\fB-p\fP, \fB--print\fP
Print the name of executables rather than execute.
.TP
.B
\fB-h\fP, \fB--help\fP
Display this help message.
.TP
.B
\fB-v\fP, \fB--version\fP
Display the version number.
.SH RETURN VALUE
The \fBsequence\fP tool returns the return code from the
first executable to fail.
.PP
If the executable was interrupted with a signal, the return
code is the signal number plus 128.
.PP
If the executable could not be executed, or if the \fIoptions\fP
are invalid, the status 1 is returned.
.SH NOTES
When non executable files are ignored with the \fB-i\fP option, \fBsequence\fP will
ignore the EACCESS result code when trying to execute the file and move
on to the next executable. When executables are listed with \fB-p\fP,
\fBsequence\fP will make a 'best effort' check as to whether it is allowed
to run an executable, ignoring any executables that are not regular files,
and ignoring any executables that do not pass an access check. Callers are
to take care using this information to ensure that race conditions and
additional restrictions like selinux do not negatively affect the outcome.
.SH EXAMPLES
In this basic example, we execute all commands in /etc/rc3.d, passing
the parameter 'start' to each command.
~$ \fBsequence\fP /etc/rc3.d -- start
